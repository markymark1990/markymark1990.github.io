     <p>Bump is a ghost who is recently deceased and trying to get used to his new lifestyle.
        More experienced ghosts have been trying to show him the ropes, but for some reason,
        Bump does not have the same abilty as the others to walk through walls which is causing him some adjustment issues.
        This may not have been too much of an issue, however bump is also very forgetful and he is in danger of causing himself long term ghost damage.</p>
